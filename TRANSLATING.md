# Translating

Thank you for your interest in translating parts of Dorion! As of now, there is no Weblate/Crowdin interface, but don't worry, translating is still easy!

## How-to

Translations are not actually stored in this repository. They are stored [here](https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins/tree/main/i18n), in my [shelter-plugins](https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins) repository!
To create a new translation:

1. Fork [SpikeHD/shelter-plugins](https://github.com/SpikeHD/shelter-plugins)
2. Clone your Fork
3. In the `i18n` folder, copy `en.json` into another file for your language (such as `ru.json` for russian, or `ja.json` for japanese)
4. Do your translations in the new file
5. Commit + push
6. Make a pull request

That's it! Once your PR merged, you will be able to see your translation automatically apply in Dorion based on what you set your system language to.
